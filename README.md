Traffic Management – AI-Based Smart Traffic Control System

This project implements an intelligent traffic management solution using computer vision and machine learning to automatically detect vehicle density and optimize signal timings. The goal is to reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, and demonstrate a practical application of AI in smart city infrastructure.

📌 Features
